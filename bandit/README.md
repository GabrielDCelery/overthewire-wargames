| 4     | The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [Link](./level4/README.md)  |
| 5     | The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: `human-readable`, `1033 bytes in size`, `not executable`.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Link](./level5/README.md)  |
| 6     | The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:: `owned by user bandit7`, `owned by group bandit6`, `33 bytes in size`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Link](./level6/README.md)  |
| 7     | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Link](./level7/README.md)  |
| 8     | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once millionth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [Link](./level8/README.md)  |
| 9     | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [Link](./level9/README.md)  |
| 10    | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Link](./level10/README.md) |
| 11    | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Link](./level11/README.md) |
| 12    | The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!). | [Link](./level12/README.md) |
| 13    | The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.                                                                         | [Link](./level13/README.md) |
| 14    | The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [Link](./level14/README.md) |
